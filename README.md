Every four years the time comes for America to pick a new president (or choose to stick with the old one) and political news a spin flies wildly.  Amidst all this coverage, we often see a familiar map of the US showing each state as either red or blue.  This is to show which candidate won each state and it helps to clarify election results but it also creates a misrepresentation of the opinions of the American citizens.  What we are going to try to do is create a more realistic representation of the American public.  
	The traditional “Red State/Blue State” map is created by determining the color of each state by checking which side got the most votes.  What we are going to do is make each state a blend of Red and Blue (and Green for independent) based on the percentage of votes won by each party.  This will result in a large Purple map that changes subtly by each state.  We will make this program adaptable so that it can generate a map of the US that separates by state or that separates by state and county.  It should also be able to generate a map of just a certain state (decided by the user) that is separated by county.
	This project is a group assignment.  Someone in your group should make an organization on GitHub and then someone in your organization should fork the repository found on our class’s GitHub Org.  In that Repo you will find basic code to get you started, a directory of raw geographic and election data for each state and various dependencies and libraries that are necessary for NetBeans, GitHub, and other tools to build and test your program.  More information on the raw data files will be given in class and on Google Classroom.    
	Teamwork and documentation will be an important part of this project.  Each member will be required to submit at least 3 pull requests on your group’s master repo in addition to contributing an additional function that he/she is responsible for and that has been approved by Mr. Neville.  Your final project should be submitted by submitting a pull request to the class’s master repo.  You may submit as many pull requests as you would like for testing purposes; your final project will be evaluated at the due date of the project, not when you submit a pull request. 

Grading
	This project will be graded using two components, an individual component and a group component.  These will both be worth 50% of the final project grade.  The grade will be determined using the following criteria:
-	Group Component
o	Project Builds Successfully and performs all basic required functions----------- 25 pts
o	Comment Score ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15 pts
o	Active Group participation in GitHub Organiztion ------------------------------------ 10 pts
-	Individual Component 
o	3 Unique and Valuable Pull requests submitted -------------------------------------- 15 pts
o	Commit Notes and Change logs are clear and valuable ----------------------------- 10 pts
o	Added Component was approved, works, and adds value to project ------------ 25 pts
