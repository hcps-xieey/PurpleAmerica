/*
 * Political Map Project
 * Name: Bashir, Sree, Ethan 
 * Block: 6
 * 
 * Program Purpose:
 *This program's purpose is to illustrate the election data visually on a map. 
 *It does this by taking in the voting data and using an equation to generate the 
 *RGB that is associated with it. Then the map is genenrated with or without the 
 *counties and then is drawn. It is then filled in the correct RGB. The final result
 *will be a map of the US with colors representing the election data. 
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * Our algorithm was to modularize as much as possible and we made multiple classes
 * to store different methods. For example, we have one class for the counties separate 
 * from the one that draws the map without the counties. 
 *
 * Future/possible improvements:
 * One improvement we could've made was to comment and communicate much more on GIT Hub. 
 * Our communication was very poor and we didn't utilize the tools that GIT Hub has. 
 * We should've commented our code much earlier so that other members could use and 
 * comprehend that code.
